### Project goal 🎯
Reproduction of a naval battle game in C.    
The program uses signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2) and the TCP protocol to communicate between players.

### How to compile it ? 🛠️
Make the game :
```shell
make
```

Make the libs :
```shell
make libs
```

Re make the game :
```shell
# This command will deleted all the compiled files
make re
```

Remove all compiled files (*.o) :
```shell
make clean
```

<p>Remove all compiled files (*.o), all compiled libs (*.a), all unit tests and program executable  :</p>

```shell
make fclean
```

Make a unit_tests file :
```shell
make unit_tests
```

Make and run a unit_tests file with the coverage :
```shell
make tests_run
```

### How to use it ? 💻
Player 1 :
```Shell
./my_navy [map]
```
Player 2 :
```Shell
./my_navy [player_one_pid] [map]
```

### How to create a valid map ? 🛥
To make a valid map, you need a file containing 4 boats in this form : `[length]:[start_position]:[end_position]`.     
Each boat must be a different size. Boats can't be diagonal, cross each other or be on the same coordinates.

Example :
```Shell
2:C1:C2
3:D4:F4
4:B5:B8
5:D7:H7
```
